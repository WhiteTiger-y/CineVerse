## ü§ñ About The Project

CineVerse AI is a full-stack web application that redefines the movie discovery experience. Instead of simple keyword searches, it functions as a conversational partner, engaging users with friendly, indirect questions to understand their mood and preferences. Powered by a sophisticated LangChain agent using Google's Gemini, it provides tailored movie suggestions that truly resonate with the user's current state of mind.

The project features a complete user authentication system, a futuristic "glassmorphism" UI built with React and Tailwind CSS, and an intelligent backend that can search both a static knowledge base and the live web for recommendations.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

  - Node.js (v18 or later)
  - Python (v3.10 or later)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```sh
    git clone https://your-github-repo-url.com/CineVerse-Project.git
    cd CineVerse-Project
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup**

    ```sh
    # Navigate to the backend directory
    cd backend

    # Create and activate a virtual environment
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: .venv\Scripts\activate

    # Install Python packages from requirements.txt
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Create the .env file for your secrets and add your keys
    ```

    Your `backend/.env` file must contain:

    ```env
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"
    DATABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_POSTGRES_URL_(Transaction_Pooler)"
    PINECONE_API_KEY="YOUR_PINECONE_API_KEY"
    HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN="YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_READ_TOKEN"
    SECRET_KEY="A_LONG_RANDOM_SECRET_STRING_FOR_TOKENS"
    BREVO_API_KEY="YOUR_BREVO_API_KEY"
    SENDER_EMAIL="YOUR_VERIFIED_SENDER_EMAIL"
    ```

    ```sh
    # Run one-time setup scripts
    # 1. Create the tables on your cloud database
    python database.py

    # 2. Build the movie vector store (this can take a long time)
    python create_vectorstore.py

    # Run the backend server (from the main project root directory)
    cd .. 
    uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
    ```

3.  **Frontend Setup**

    ```sh
    # In a new terminal, navigate to the frontend directory
    cd frontend

    # Install dependencies
    npm install

    # Create the .env.local file for your frontend
    ```

    Your `frontend/.env.local` file must contain:

    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
    ```

    ```sh
    # Run the frontend development server
    npm run dev
    ```

    Your application will be live at `http://localhost:3000`.
