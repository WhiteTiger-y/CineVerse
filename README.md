## ü§ñ About The Project

CineVerse AI is more than just a search engine for movies; it's a conversational partner designed to help you find the perfect film. It goes beyond simple genre or title searches by engaging in natural conversation to understand your mood and preferences. By analyzing the nuances of the chat, it suggests movies that you're truly in the mood for.

The project features a sleek, modern UI with a futuristic purple-and-black theme, complete with smooth animations and a 3D "floating" interface.
