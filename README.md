## ü§ñ About The Project

CineVerse AI is a full-stack web application that redefines the movie discovery experience. Instead of simple keyword searches, it functions as a conversational partner, engaging users with friendly, indirect questions to understand their mood and preferences. Powered by a sophisticated LangChain agent using Google's Gemini, it provides tailored movie suggestions that truly resonate with the user's current state of mind.

The project features a complete user authentication system, a futuristic "glassmorphism" UI built with React and Tailwind CSS, and an intelligent backend that can search both a static knowledge base and the live web for recommendations.
